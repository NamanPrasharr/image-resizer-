# Image Resizer using OpenCV

## Overview
This project provides a simple way to resize images using Python and OpenCV. It allows users to specify custom width and height values to resize an image efficiently.

## Features
- Load an image from a local directory.
- Resize the image to custom dimensions.
- Save the resized image in the desired format.
- Utilizes OpenCV for efficient image processing.

## Requirements
To run this program, you need to have Python installed along with the following dependencies:
- `opencv-python`

You can install the required dependency using:
```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

## How to Use
1. Place your image in the same directory as the script.
2. Specify the image name and format.
3. Set the desired width and height for resizing.
4. Run the script to generate the resized image.

## Use Cases
- Reducing image size for web optimization.
- Standardizing image dimensions for machine learning applications.
- Resizing profile pictures and thumbnails.
